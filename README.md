# paper

Jan 6th, prepare for conference, code demo, jupyternote book. environmen setting: google codelab?

//2-3 page proposa in sprint
proper scientific writing
alexnet? ImageNet
Inception changes over time VGG16-19
ResNet

each layer (conv, pooling, activation)
back-propagation
top vs bottom layers (harder to train than top)
transfer learning, final layers only for training?

compare with inception
